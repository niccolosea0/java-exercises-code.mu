# Java Solutions – code.mu Tasker / Stager

My solutions to the Java programming exercises from  
https://code.mu/en/java/tasker/stager/

The tasks are organized by difficulty levels (Level 1 → Level 10), starting from basic syntax and going up to more advanced topics (collections, OOP patterns, algorithms, etc.).

## How I'm solving them

- Trying to write clean, readable code with
- Adding comments explaining non-obvious parts  
- Sometimes including alternative solutions  
- Following the task description exactly (no extra libraries unless really needed)

## Progress

## Why I made this repo

I'm systematically working through the code.mu Java taskbook to build solid fundamentals → intermediate → advanced Java skills.  
Feel free to compare solutions or use as reference (but please try to solve tasks yourself first!).
